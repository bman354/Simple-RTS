"# Simple-RTS" 

I started this project with the intention of making a fully fleshed out Real Time Strategy game, mimicing the original Starcraft or Age of empires.

While this was nowhere near fully realized, I found the world generation part fascinating, and ended up focusing more on the world generation itself. This is now a platform for me to experiement with pseudo randomness, 
world generation strategies, tile stitching, and rendering algorithms
